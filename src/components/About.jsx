        This game is for a group of people who want to have fun and get to know each other more. 
        There are dares and questions, and is for 2 or more people who can handle getting a little silly, but not scandalous.

      <p>
        If you are trying to party, it can also be a drinking game where the selected person 
        for each round drinks and/or chooses someone to drink.
